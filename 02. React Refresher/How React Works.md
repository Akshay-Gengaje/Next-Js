# How react works?

    React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs), specifically for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows developers to build reusable UI components that can be composed together to form complex user interfaces. React manages the state of these components efficiently and updates the UI automatically when the state changes, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

    At its core, React utilizes a declarative programming paradigm, where developers describe how the UI should look based on the current state of the application. React takes care of efficiently updating the DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect these changes.

React consists of two main libraries:

1. **React**: This library provides the core functionality of React, including the component model, state management, and the Virtual DOM.

2. **ReactDOM**: This library is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM. It provides methods for mounting React components into the DOM, updating them when the state changes, and unmounting them when they are no longer needed.

Now, let's break down the starting code you provided:

```javascript
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Here's what's happening:

1. `ReactDOM.createRoot`: This method creates a root React DOM node for rendering the application. It takes the DOM element where the root of the React component tree will be mounted as an argument. In this case, it's the element with the id `'root'`.

2. `.render()`: This method is used to render React elements into the DOM. It takes two arguments: the React element to render and the container element where it should be rendered. In this code snippet, it's rendering the `<App />` component into the root node created with `createRoot`.

3. `<React.StrictMode>`: This is a component provided by React that enables strict mode. Strict mode helps identify potential problems in your code and highlights them for you. It activates additional checks and warnings for various aspects of your application, such as deprecated lifecycle methods, unsafe lifecycle methods, and legacy string ref usage. Wrapping your entire application or individual components with `<React.StrictMode>` helps in catching and fixing potential issues early.

4. `<App />`: This is a placeholder for the root component of your application. You would replace `<App />` with the actual root component of your application, which typically contains other components composing your UI.

So, in summary, the provided code initializes a React application, creates a root node in the DOM, renders the `<App />` component inside `<React.StrictMode>`, and attaches it to the specified DOM element with the id `'root'`.
